### 1. standards can be benefitial to the Flow ecosystem because 
* standard will be beneficial foe newbies like me to make less mistake.
* if a standard is been implemented and audited then it will be face less security theats ðŸŽ­ in future.
* if everyone use same standard then code will not be repeated on blockchain and it will saves space.
etc.
