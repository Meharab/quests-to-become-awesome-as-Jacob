### "force casting" with `as!` it "downcasts" a generic type to a more specific type. it useful in our Collection because it will help dipositing any `@NonFungibleToken.NFT` type and downcast to `@NFT`.

### `auth` help us to authorize reference to the certain type. we use it when we need to downcast a reference to certain type. 1st we authorize reference to certain type bt `auth` and then force cast to certain type by `as!`.
