#### the other ways to distribute `Minters` to other people WITHOUT having to have 2 signers can be done in two steps:
* 1st the `creator` should `borrow` the `minter` reference from storage and create a public `link` of `minter` reference 
* then the `recipient` should create `public Capability` to borrow the reference of `minter` and create a new `minter` and `save` to his storage
