### 1. a account can contain 2 thimgs
* multiple smart contract.
* account storage e.g. `/storage/`, `/public/`, and `/private/` where you can storge datas from you smart contract.

### 2. difference between the `/storage/`, `/public/`, and `/private/` paths are:
* `/storage/` - only the account owner can access this. ALL the datas lives here.
* `/public/` - anybody can access it from anywhere.
* `/private/` - only available to the account owner and the people that the account owner gives access to.

#### 3.a.`.save()` is the ketword that allows only the account holder to save data in his account storage. e.g. 
      `account.save(<- xResource, to: /storage/xResource) `
#### 3.b. `.load()` is the keyword that allows only account holder to load the data that was stored in his account storage e.g. 
      `let load <- signer.load<@Cont.Reso>(from: /storage/xResource)!`
#### 3.c. `.borrow()` is the keyword that allows user to borrow the data that was stored in some other account storage e.g. 
      `let borrow = signer.borrow<&Cont.Reso>(from: /storage/xResource) ?? panic("do not panic!")`

#### 4. the reason why we couldn't save something to our account storage inside of a script because to save data you will need `AuthAccount` that allows only account holder to save data but `AuthAccount` can only be able to used in `transaction` section.

#### 5. the reason why you couldn't save something to my account because only account holder of an account can save datas on his storage.

# Contract
```cadence
pub contract Anime {

  pub resource List {
    pub var name: String
    init() {
      self.name = "A Silent ðŸ˜¶ Voice"
    }
  }

  pub fun addList(): @List {
    return <- create List()
  }

}
```
# i) Transaction 1
```cadence
import Anime from 0x01
transaction() {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    let store <- Anime.addList()
    signer.save(<- store, to: /storage/MyStorage)
    let load <- signer.load<@Anime.List>(from: /storage/MyStorage)!
                          //?? panic("do not panic!")
    log(load.name)
    destroy load
  }

  execute {

  }
}
```
# ii) Transaction 2
```cadence
import Anime from 0x01
transaction() {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    let store <- Anime.addList()
    signer.save(<- store, to: /storage/MyStorage)
    let borrow = signer.borrow<&Anime.List>(from: /storage/MyStorage)
                          ?? panic("do not panic.")
    log(borrow.name)
  }

  execute {

  }
}
```
