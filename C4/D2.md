#### 1. `.link()` is a function that allows uses to expose theirs datas to the `/public/` or `/private/` path from `/storage/` path, so that other uses can use that link to read the data.

#### 2. we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the `/public/` path because a resource may contain a lot of functions and variables but resource interface not necessarily needs to contain all the function and variable that a resource have. So we can design resource interface in such a way that we want to expose to `/public/` path. So that we can use that resource interface to put restrictions on `.capability()` and `.link()` to control the outcome what we are exposing to `/public/` path.
