#### 1. the two main reasons we add a Collection to this contract are
* to create a "Collection," or a container that wraps all of our NFTs into one. Then, we can store the Collection at 1 storage path.
* also allow others to "deposit" into that Collection.

#### 2. if we have resources "nested" inside of another resource("Nested resources"), we MUST declare a destroy function that manually destroys those "nested" resources with the destroy keyword.

#### 3. Thinks that might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it are:
* Idea #1: i think we will need some kind of funtion that allow only deployer to mint NFT and later deployer can transfer to anyone.
* Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, we can create a function that have the reference of that resource so that we don't have to withdraw every time if we want to read the metadata.
