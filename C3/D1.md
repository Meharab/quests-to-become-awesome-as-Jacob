### 1. 3 reasons why structs are different from resources.
* resource cannot be copied or lost (or overwritten) but stuct can.
* resource cannot be created whenever you want but struct can.
* resource must be explicit about handling or moving but struct not very much.

### 2. situation where a resource might be better to use than a struct:
* when you need super unique data. e.g. NFT, UID, Metadata etc.
* when your data can't be copied or lost. e.g. CIA documents, datas of Nuclear Bomb ðŸ’£ activation code ðŸ˜… etc.
* when your data is super delicate and need high security. e.g. password, President's secret code for super secret room etc.
etc.

### 3. the keyword to make a new resource is `create`.

### 4. resource can't be created in a script or transaction (assuming there isn't a public function to create one on contact).

### 5. its public `@Jacob` type resource.
```cadence
pub resource Jacob {

}
```

### 6. fixed 'I Spy' contract:
```cadence
pub contract Test {

    pub resource Jacob {
        pub let rocks: Bool
        init() {
            self.rocks = true
        }
    }

    pub fun createJacob(): @Jacob { 
        let myJacob <- create Jacob()
        return <- myJacob
    }
}
```
