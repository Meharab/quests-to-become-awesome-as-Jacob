### 3. the force unwrap operator `!` is used for unwrapping the optional value. if the value is nil then it will panic and abort the program otherwise it will revel linear type value. for example think a banana as an optional when you will force unwrap (a.k.a peal the banana) you may linear value (a.k.a fresh) or nil (a.k.a rotten). if you find rotten banana you will panic and throw it away.
```swift
pub fun main(): Int {
    let thing: {String: String} = {"Shizuka": "Dorimon", "Shoko": "A silent voice", "Khaguya": "Love is war"}
    return thing["Shoko"]! //  force-unwrap operator
}
```
### 4.a. It means it is an optional, so it may be String or it may be nil
### 4.b. When accessing elements of a dictionary, it returns the value as an `optional`. But main function return type is `String`.
### 4.c. In order to fix this error, we have to use the force-unwrap operator `!`
