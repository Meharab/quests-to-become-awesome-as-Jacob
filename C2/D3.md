# 1. Script
```cadence
pub fun main() {
  var people: [String] = ["Shizuka from Dorimon", "Shoko from A silent voice", "Khaguya from Love is war"]
  log(people)
}
```
# 2. Script
```cadence
pub fun main() {
  var people: {String: UInt64} = {"Facebook": 4, "Instagram": 5, "Twitter": 3, "YouTube": 1, "Reddit": 0, "LinkedIn": 2 }
  log(people)
}

### 3. the force unwrap operator `!` is used for unwrapping the `optional` value. if the value is `nil` then it will panic and abort the program otherwise it will revel `linear type` value. for example think a banana as an `optional` when you will force unwrap `!` (a.k.a peal the banana) you may `linear value` (a.k.a fresh) or `nil` (a.k.a rotten). if you find rotten banana you will panic and throw it away.
```cadence
pub fun main(): Int {
    let thing: {String: String} = {"Shizuka": "Dorimon", "Shoko": "A silent voice", "Khaguya": "Love is war"}
    return thing["Shoko"]! //  force-unwrap operator
}
```
### 4.a. It means it is an `optional`, so it may be `String` or it may be `nil`.
### 4.b. When accessing elements of a `dictionary`, it returns the value as an `optional`. But main function return type is `String`.
### 4.c. In order to fix this error, we have to use the force-unwrap operator `!`
