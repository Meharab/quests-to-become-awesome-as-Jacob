### 1. we wouldn't call `changeGreeting` in script because script section is only used for reading datas from on chain. But `changeGreeting` function change the state of `greeting` variable.
### 2. in the prepare phase of the transaction `AuthAccount` defines the account that creating the transaction.
### 3. difference between the `prepare` phase and the `execute` phase in the transaction is in the `prepare` phase we used this phase accessing any data in the account and in the `execute` phase we used it changing some data in the smart contract. But it is not necessary. in `prepare` section we can write both but it is best practice to separate assign and execution.

# Contract
```cadence
pub contract Jacob {

    pub var myNumber: Int

    init() {
        self.myNumber = 0
    }

    pub fun updateMyNumber(newNumber: Int) {
        self.myNumber = newNumber
    }
}
```

# Transaction
```cadence
import Jacob from 0x01

transaction(myNewNumber: Int) {

  prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {}

  execute {
    Jacob.updateMyNumber(newNumber: myNewNumber)
  }
}
```

# Script
```cadence
import Jacob from 0x1

pub fun main(): Int {
  return Jacob.myNumber
}
```
